# SSHM â€“ SSH Menu

A tool for interactively selecting an SSH host from your `~/.ssh/config` file.

![Usage](./usage.gif)

Did you know that you can use aliases for your SSH credentials and simply type `ssh my-fav-server` instead of `ssh admin@127.0.0.1 -p 2210`?

To do this, you need to create a `~/.ssh/config` file with contents similar to:

```
Host "always down prod"
    HostName 127.0.0.1
    User root
    Port 22

Host my-fav-server
    HostName 127.0.0.1
    User admin
    Port 2210

Host "ðŸ˜Ž some cool server"
    HostName 127.0.0.1
    User dude
    Port 2211
```

However, even with this setup, you'll still have to remember all the fancy names you've given to your servers. This simple tool is designed to provide a convenient menu of your hosts.
